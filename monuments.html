        <p class="cityhall-text">
          Leiden City Hall (Stadhuis van Leiden) is a grand Renaissance-style building that serves as the administrative heart of the city. 
          Originally built in the 14th century, it has been rebuilt several times, with its most iconic façade dating from 1597. 
          The building was heavily damaged by a fire in 1929, but the front was carefully restored to its former glory, while the rest of the structure was modernized. 
          The city hall’s intricate stonework, decorative sculptures, and towering clock face reflect its historical importance. Located on the Breestraat, 
          it has witnessed countless events, from political decisions to cultural celebrations. The interior hosts official ceremonies, council meetings, 
          and public events, preserving its status as both a functional civic center and an important historical landmark in Leiden.
